# WebSocket Implementation Requirements

## Event Triggers

1. Bug Reports:
   - When a new bug report is created
   - When a bug report is updated
   - When a bug report's status changes
   - When a bug report is assigned/unassigned
   - When a bug report is deleted

2. Comments:
   - When a new comment is added
   - When a comment is updated
   - When a comment is deleted

3. Projects:
   - When a new project is created
   - When a project details are updated
   - When a project is deleted

4. Users:
   - When a new user is created
   - When user details are updated
   - When a user's status changes
   - When a user is deleted

5. Notifications:
   - When a bug is assigned to a user
   - When a comment is added to a bug report
   - When a bug report's status changes
   - When a reminder is sent

## Connection Management
1. Authentication:
   - Validate token on connection
   - Maintain user context
   - Handle token expiration

2. Reconnection:
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Maximum retry attempts: 5
   - Initial retry delay: 2 seconds

3. Connection State:
   - Track connected clients
   - Monitor connection health
   - Handle graceful disconnection

## Error Handling
1. Connection Errors:
   - Invalid token
   - Connection timeout
   - Network issues

2. Message Errors:
   - Invalid message format
   - Unknown event type
   - Missing required fields

3. Error Response Format:
{
    "type": "error",
    "payload": {
        "code": "error_code",
        "message": "Error description"
    }
}

## Rate Limiting
- Maximum connections per user: 3
- Message rate limit: 60 per minute
- Implement token bucket algorithm

## Security Requirements
1. Authentication:
   - JWT token validation
   - Role-based access control
   - Token expiration handling

2. Data Validation:
   - Sanitize all input
   - Validate message format
   - Check field constraints

3. Connection Security:
   - Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) in production
   - Implement origin checking
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

## Database Integration
1. Real-time Updates:
   - Listen for database changes
   - Trigger appropriate WebSocket events
   - Maintain data consistency

2. Caching:
   - Implement caching for frequent data
   - Cache invalidation strategy
   - Handle race conditions

## Performance Considerations
1. Connection Pooling:
   - Manage connection pool size
   - Monitor connection usage
   - Implement connection cleanup

2. Message Queue:
   - Buffer messages during high load
   - Implement message prioritization
   - Handle backpressure

3. Scaling:
   - Support horizontal scaling
   - Load balancing strategy
   - State synchronization across instances

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test all event handlers
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test reconnection logic

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test end-to-end communication
   - Test with multiple clients
   - Test under load

3. Performance Tests:
   - Test connection limits
   - Test message throughput
   - Test under network conditions

## Monitoring
1. Metrics:
   - Active connections
   - Message rate
   - Error rate
   - Latency

2. Logging:
   - Connection events
   - Message events
   - Error events
   - Performance metrics

3. Alerts:
   - High error rate
   - Connection spikes
   - Performance degradation
